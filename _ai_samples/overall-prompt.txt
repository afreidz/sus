You are about to receive an array of summaries in JSON format. The
summaries are from user tests of {APP}. Your job is to aggregate the summaries focusing on the following:

* determine common pain-points based on failed tasks and feedback
* determine common well-performing aspects of the prototype based on feedback and tasks
* make suggestions based on feedback and tasks
* provide a general summarization of the postive and negative aspects of the prototype

The summary should be short and suitable for a power point slide. Also, return the summary in json format with the
following properties:

* "feedback" which should be an array of summarized feedback strings
* "results" which should be an array of highlights from the tasks
* "suggestions" which should be an array of suggestion strings based on the findings
* "summary" which should be the general summarization string

Here are the summaries:
