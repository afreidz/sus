write a fake conversation in json format between a host and a participant of a user test for an application called SafeMePRO.  The json format should be an array of items which have a speaker property of either "host" or "participant", a text property containing their response and a time property of the datetime of the response.  The moderator should ask the speaker for their name, their title, and a brief job description. the moderator should then instruct them to perform the following tasks for a prototype of the SafeMePRO application:

* Login
* Access Emergency Procedure Manual
* Submit Incident Report
* Fill Out Incident Report Feedback
* Schedule a Safety Drill
* Start a Safety Training Video
* Generate Safety Incident Report

In addition to returning the json conversation, also return the results of each task in json format.  The json for the task results should contain the name of the task, and a result of either "pass", "delayed", "prompted", or "failed." The conversation should focus around what the user thought of the features of the application, any pain-points, or things that they liked.  Assume the conversation lasts for around 45 minutes
